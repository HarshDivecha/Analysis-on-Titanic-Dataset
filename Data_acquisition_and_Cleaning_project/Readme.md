This notebook is intended to display these skills:

- Acquire data for analysis.
- Combining different datasets for a more in depth analysis.
- Data cleaning to create a tidy data for analysis by anyone.
- Depending on data at hand, possibilities of analysing and presenting in different formats ( in this case using lattitude and longitude from a random data and using it at our advantage to create a map representation).
